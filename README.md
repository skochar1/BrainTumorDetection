# Context
We worked on this project to practice training a CNN for practical purposes. In this specific notebook, there are four types of images being looked at: brains without tumors, brains with pituitary tumors, brains with gliomas, and brains with meningiomas. We used several python libraries (numpy, keras, pytorch, matplotlib, etc.) to do this. 

# About us
This project was created by Aneesha Sreerama and Shreya Kochar, two college students. Shreya is a computer science major at Wellesley College, while Aneesha is a data science major at Northeastern University.
